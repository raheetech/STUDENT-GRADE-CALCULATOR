# STUDENT-GRADE-CALCULATOR

Grade Calculator Program Description

The Grade Calculator program is designed to help users calculate their total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade based on the marks obtained in each subject.

Features:

Input Marks: The program prompts the user to input marks obtained in each subject (out of 100). It validates the input to ensure that marks are within the range of 0 to 100.

Calculate Total Marks: It calculates the total marks obtained by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects.

Calculate Average Percentage: The program divides the total marks by the total number of subjects to calculate the average percentage.

Grade Calculation: Based on the average percentage achieved, the program assigns grades to the user. It follows a simple grading system where:

A: 90% and above
B: 80% - 89%
C: 70% - 79%
D: 60% - 69%
F: Below 60%
Display Results: Finally, the program displays the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
